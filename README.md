# Ego-Quest-Front-End

Welcome to the Ego Quest frontend repository. Ego Quest is a calorie tracking application. This repository specifically hosts the frontend portion of the application, responsible for the user interface and interaction with the backend.

## Overview

Ego Quest is an application that allows users to track their daily caloric intake. Users can search for foods, view their nutritional information, and add them to their daily log. The frontend of Ego Quest provides a simple and intuitive interface for these interactions, and communicates with the backend to store and retrieve user data and food entries.

## Wireframes

## Technologies

The frontend is built with the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## Structure

The application consists of the following main files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web page. It includes the necessary elements for users to interact with, such as search bars, buttons, and display areas.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code that powers the functionality of the application. This includes event listeners for user interactions, functions for communicating with the backend API, and logic for updating the displayed content based on user input and retrieved data.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the application, defining the visual appearance of the web page. This includes styles for layout, colors, typography, and more.

## Third-Party API

This application makes use of the USDA Food Database API to provide data about nutrient content in a variety of foods.


## Deployment

Our frontend is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed at the following link: *Add your Vercel deployment link here*.

Please note that the frontend and backend are hosted in separate repositories. You can find the backend repository and its respective README at the following link: *Add your backend GitHub repository link here*.

We hope this project provides valuable insights and a useful tool for tracking dietary intake.
